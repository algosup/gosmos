# Gosmos is a version of the classic Space Invaders in Go 
It is written for educational purpose and to limit the number of new concepts, we may deviate from idiomatic Go at times.
<br/>To build it from source and run it on your machine, you need to install :
1) Git https://git-scm.com/downloads
2) Optional: Visual Studio Code (or any editor/IDE or your choice) https://code.visualstudio.com/download (only if you want to be able to change the code)
3) Go https://golang.org/dl/

Then, you need to get the source code by running the command 
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/algosup/gosmos.git </code></pre>
in a terminal.
To run the code, move to the gosmos folder:
<pre><code>cd gosmos</code></pre>
Then run
<pre><code>go run .</code></pre>
